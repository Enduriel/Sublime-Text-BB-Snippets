# Installation

Download the source code as a ZIP. Then, change the extension of the zip file to .sublime-package (instead of Sublime-squirrel-master.zip it should now be Sublime-squirrel-master.sublime-package).

Open up your Sublime Text packages directory (%appdata%/Sublime Text/Installed Packages). 

Copy the file with the new extension to that directory.
